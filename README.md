# Overview

NeVIS is a FPGA backend for running and deploying spiking neural networks.

# Summary

This repository contains the Python code for the compiler and prototype GUI interface. In its current iteration, it is designed to compile models made by the Nengo neural simulator. 

This repository also contains example code for running a simple spiking neural network, which is built using example code from Nengo's documentation (https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/advanced/nef-algorithm.html).
